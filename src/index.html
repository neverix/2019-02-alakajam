        <p id=p1>This is a story about a cat. He lived like a normal cat, until one day...</p>
        <p id=p2>He decided to go out and enjoy the spring. He crossed the road, and a car hit him.</p>
        <p id=p3>He woke up in a strange dungeon. It seemed very unwelcoming and dangerous...</p>
        <p id=p4>He then saw some rats, and his intincts told him that they are not his friends. Right next to them,
            there
            were blue orbs of energy. The rats would run away if they hit them.</p>
        <p id=p5>"I must use the orbs to defeat the rats!", - he thought.</p>
